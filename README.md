> Group School Project - Ionic Angular App

Our group school project involved creating an Ionic Angular app that displays all students in a visually appealing way. The app includes 4 different color themes for users to choose from.

## Technology Used

- Ionic Angular
- HTML/CSS
- Tailwind
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Backend and API

We created a custom backend using Node.js and Express.js. Our backend includes an API that the app uses to display student data. The API retrieves data from a MariaDB database, which stores information about each student, including their name, age, and photo.

## Features

The app has the following features:

- Visual display of all students
- 4 color themes
- Search bar to search for specific students
- Profile pages for each student, including their photo, name, and age
- Overview Page, with Class and Teacher information

## Releases
The latest version: v1.0b
